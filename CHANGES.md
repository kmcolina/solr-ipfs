# SolrWayback changelog


4.3.0
-----
Updated frontend dependencies (security)

Added support for WARC file reading with Inputstream, this can be used if WARC files are not on a file-system. (Skipping HttpInputStream implementation for reading WARCs with offset)

Warc-indexer not supports WARC type 'resource' without URL in WARC header  (Typical created with Warcit from a file system)

Minor Solr query syntax fix, so it will also work on Solr 6. (not recommended to use Solr6!)

Docker support. Only recommended for trying a demo SolrWayback if you do not want to use the bundle install. See README for more info.

Support for legacy WARC-Indexer before version 3.0 that does not have url_norm field. (not recommended)

Fixed n-gram to show statistics for years after 2020.

SolrWayback can now be deployed at a deeper url than 'https://kb.dk/solrwayback' . Etc. : 'https://kb.dk/covid-collection/solrwayback'.

If the webapp base above is not just domain/solrwayback, then an additional property needs to be defined in solrwaybackweb.properties. In the case above the property : webapp.prefix=/covid-collection/solrwayback/  . See more in the README.md how to install SolrWayback under another subdirectory after domain. If the property is not defined it will default to /solrwayback/

When loading binaries from WARC-file+offset check that the the resource is in the collection (in Solr). This will prevent URL hacking from guessing WARC-files and offset that is not in the collection but on the file-system. This can be enabled by new a property. Enabled this property will have minor performance impact on playback.

Solr memory increased from 512MB to 1024MB in SolrWayback bundle. Some large text blocks in WARC files could cause Solr memory error with multiple threads.

###### New properties:

New optional property in solwayback.properties 'fields'. Will default to all fields if not defined. Use comma seperated list of fields to be shown when clicking "Show Data fields" from the results page.

New optional property in solwayback.properties 'url.normaliser'. Will default to normal. Other options are minimal and legacy. 

New optional property in solwayback.properties 'solr.search.params'. Add default solr params to every query.

New optional property in solwayback.properties 'warc.files.verify.collection'. Default false. Will check WARC file +offset is in the collection before returning binaries.

New optional property in solrwayback.properties 'playback.disabled'.Default false. If set to true all playback and access to binaries (pdf, full size images etc.) will be disabled. Will only allow images tumbnail preview 200*200 pixels.

New optional property in solrwaybackweb.properties 'search.uploaded.file.disabled'. Default false. If set to true search by fileupload (hash-value) will be disabled.

New optional property in solrwaybackweb.properties 'webapp.prefix'. Default to /solrwayback/. If SolrWayback is deployed at kb.dk/covid-19/solrwayback, then set this property to '/covid-19/solrwayback/'


4.2.3
-----
Fixed in-player video player for some MP4 videos that was classified by Tika as 'application/mp4'.
Fixed log4shell vulnerability in SolrWayback bundle (Solr and warc-indexer)


4.2.2
-----
Support for Warc record type 'resource'. Also required fix in the warc-indexer and resourcetype added to config3.xml (in indexing folder)
Improved playback for Twitter API harvest (https://github.com/netarchivesuite/so-me). (also changes in solrconfig.xml)
Implemented new WARC file resolver. If WARCS files are removed after indexed, you can add a text file with the new location. Whenever a WARC needs needs to be loaded, if the WARC file is on the list, it will use that location instead of the one indexed into Solr.

4.2.1
-----
Further improvements in serviceworker:
a) The SolrWaybackRoot-servlet application is no longer required if the Serviceworker is loaded. For legacy browsers where servicerworker does not work, the root servlet will required for improved playback.
b) In rare cases referer is missing so crawltime for the origin resource is unknown. As a default it uses current year as crawltime. This situation is often not relevant for playback since the requests often are to trackers and adds.

Cleaned up in logging to the solrwayback.log file. It should not be as spammy now.
Upgraded frontend dependencies   (security updates).   

Fixed bug in load more facets for domain facet when there also was a filter query involved.

4.2.0
-----
All Playback live leaks are now blocked or redirected back to SolrWayback with a javascript Serviceworker added to playback. No more leaking to the live web!  This will also improve playback when the live leak can be resolved in SolrWayback. (Thanks to Ilya Kreymer for pointing me in this direction). 
The Serviceworker implementation require the SolrWayback server to run under HTTPS. This can be archived by setting an Apache or Nginx in front of the Tomcat.
The Serviceworker feature is supported by most recent browser versions. See: https://caniuse.com/serviceworkers 
Playback will still work in legacy browsers using url rewrite, but can leak to the live web in if not blocked by proxy server or sandboxed. 
Encoding fix in javascript rewrite: Modify < > handling to preserve the original representation (including faulty ones). This closes SOLRWBFB-58
Upgraded frontend depencencies (security updates).


4.1.2
-----
Wordcloud stop words works can be configured in solrwaybackweb.properties.
Added new property(wordcloud.stopwords) in solrwaybackweb.properties with default stopwords (english). Will use empty stopword list if not defined
Word cloud html pages extraction reduced from 10.000 to 5.000 as difference was minimal, but doubles performance
API method to extract word+count for a query+filterquery(optional) :  /services/frontend/wordcloud/wordfrequency?q=xxx&fg=yyy
API method to extract wordcloud image for query+filterquery(optional): /services/frontend/wordcloud/query?q=xxx&fg=yyy

Solr query caching for performance boost. 
Added new optional properties in solrwayback.properties
#Solr caching. Will be default false if not defined
solr.server.caching=true
solr.server.caching.max.entries=10000
solr.server.caching.age.seconds=86400

When clicking a link and opening playback in a new tab. The browser URL will match the crawl-time of the html page.

4.1.1
-----
Added a better parallel indexing script for Linux/macOS with more options. (warc-indexer.sh)
With warc-indexer.sh you can define number of threads. It keeps track of already index WARC-file so you can start it again after adding new WARC-files to the folder.
Example: THREADS=20 ./warc-indexer.sh warcs1

The file location of the two property-files solrwayback.properties and solrwaybackweb.properties can be configured so they do not have
to be in the HOME directory. 
To change to location copy this file: https://github.com/netarchivesuite/solrwayback/blob/master/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml
to the folder '/apache-tomcat-8.5.60/conf/Catalina/localhost' and rename it to solrwayback.war
Remnove the uncomment of the environment variables and edit the location of the files. During start up of the tomcat server, the
values will be logged in solrwayback.log.
  
Updated the README.md with more information about scaling and using SolrWayback in production.

-----
Indexing scripts updated for SolrWayback Bundle
SolrWayback bundle release 4.1.0 uploaded to Github releases

4.0.7
-----
Fixed chunked transfer encoding error when HTTP header declared it was chunked, but was not.

New optional properties can be added to solrwaybackweb.properties to limit maximum number of export results.
These values is their default values.

# Limit export size
# 10M for CSV , 1M for warc, 10K for warc-expanded
# For warc.expanded the total number of documents can be many times the max-results size.        

export.csv.maxresults=10000000

export.warc.maxresults=1000000 

export.warc.expanded.maxresults=10000

```





3.2.6
-----
Twitter API playback updated and improved (require newer version of warc-indexer)
Timing logs for solr query, both for Solr Qtime and total time seen from SolrClient.  
Fixes UTC timing bug for some date conversion.
General cleanup and refactoring.
Few playback improvements (the 'utf-8' error fixed)
Attempt to fixed pagination (20+20 = 2020 instead of 40 in javascript). Probably only happens in some browsers. 

3.2.5
-----
Security/Vulnerability fix for all frontend dependencies.
Minor playback improvements (special characters like \ in url)


3.2.4
-----
Fixed white-space before url in PWID xml generation

PWID service. Can query collection for a PWID.
syntax is: (server)/services/pwid/web/urn:pwid:netarkivet.dk:2018-12-10T06:27:01Z:part:https://www.petdreams.dk/katteracer-siameser
Will return the document is collection(netarkivet) is correct and the given url (https://www.petdreams.dk/katteracer-siameser) is harvest
exactly on 2018-12-10T06:27:01Z.
For HTML pages playback will be shown, for resources (images etc.) the binary will be returned.

3.2.3
-----
Link graph export to cvs-format that can be loaded by Gephi. Export is streaming and can extract million of domains.
Implemented temporary web-page for the link graph export. (New menu link added)
Warc files made with WebRecorder can be now be indexed and gives better playback than with Heritrix3 warc-files. Fixes was mostly in the warc-indexer(Gzip support).
Improved Playback for twitter-API harvest. (missing images in some situations)
Various minor playback improvements. background-image for div tags most important fix. 
Minor fix with SVG images, converting them to PNG and scaling caused all kind of java troubles with ImagesIO.

3.2.2
-----
Property to also disable CSV export of result. Was already implemented for warc-export.
New property allow.export.csv=false in solrwaybackweb.properties
Various playback fixed when redirecting. Fixed a bug with redirect http -> https as only difference in URL.
Block redirect cycles early when detected to prevent browser going for maximum redirects.
Backend method to see the arc/warc header, not implemented in frontend yet.
Updated log-frame(slf4j) to 1.7.21
  

3.2.1
-----
Fix issued with warc-indexer 3.0.0 -> 3.0.1 broke backwards solr schema compatibility. Also some url normalization bugs was fixed. 
A property in solrwayback.properties can enable using the old schema if you dont want to reindex with warc-indexer 3.0.1.
 


3.2.0
-----
Apache2 license added.

Search option to group by URL, unchecked as default since it makes search slower. This will only show one result for the same URL.

When exporting a resultset to WARC-format there is an option to 'expand' HTML documents so all their resources are exported as well.

Added both 127.0.0.1 and localhost to solrwayback.properties proxy allow property. Required for supporting both socks proxy 4 and socks proxy 4a.
 
Domain statistics moved to search interface.

Graceful shutdown of socks proxy (fixing deploy to tomcat issue for developers)

Option property to link to an additional playback engine (local open wayback, archive.org etc.). Link is placed next to the Solrwayback playback link on title.
   
Playback improvements. (img srcset tag, embed url,  video/audio having nested source-tags)
  
Search by entering URL option in search interface. This will also convert the URL from IDN to puny code, making search by URL easier.

Faster search but only loading the fields showing in the short record presentation. Only load all fields when showing them for a record. For index-size > 300GB this is a factor 2 or more.
   
Domain growth stats graph also included in search-frontend and not only playback toolbar.

GPS image search. Replaced google maps with leaflet.js - Leaflet javascript/css included in WAR file. Map properties in solrwaybackweb.properties renamed, google prefix removed.

For image GPS search the start location parameters extracted to property-file.

For PID export the collection name has been extracted to property file.

For screenshot preview using headless chrome, the timeout parameter has been extracted to property-file. Optional, 10 seconds is default

Facets are now  defined in the property file (solrwaybackweb.properties), optional property.

If SolrWayback is deployed in the tomcat under another contextname than solrwayback, it will try load a property file with that context name before defaulting to solrwayback.properties.

Showing HTTP status code in toolbar. Also show toolbar for empty responses (301,302 etc.)
 
Rewrite of frontend urls so SolrWayback can run as HTTPS.

API for generating Wordcloud image generator for domain: http://server:port/solrwayback/services/wordcloud/domain?domain=test.dk
